# to Do

1. extract axios request to a separate api.js file 

2. fix sort by bug with utils function and testing - SortTopicsForm.jsx

3. extract votes Patch to a utils function as I will be using it again in comments

4. sort out the date formatting on articles and comments

## Check with Paul 

1. in both Nav with the appearing form and Article with the votes I am not calling componentDidUpdate, am I causing more rendering than I need to 

2. Am I over compartmentalising things? 

3. Am I using too many class based components?
